# Movie Review Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using machine learning classification techniques. The objective is to classify reviews as positive or negative based on the text.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the [IMDb Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews), which contains:
- 50,000 movie reviews.
- Labels for sentiment classification (positive/negative).

## Features
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Evaluation metrics including:
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix Visualization
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - Text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn (optional, for better visualization)
